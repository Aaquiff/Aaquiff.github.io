I have a Bsc Software Engineering from Curtin university, Australia where I was awarded for the best performance and 1st Class Honours Bachelor's degree from Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology. Awarded the IFS scholarship, I was able to work at IFS as a software developer for more than 3 years while continuing studies through which I was able to gain valuable experience in developing frameworks for enterprise applications. Through leading projects, I have also gained valuable experience in planning and leading software development teams.

I am keen in learning new technologies, sharing my knowledge and especially solving problems.
